**Disclaimer**: This post is deeply personal and is of a completely different nature to the other objective. Read it with a pinch of salt and don't take it too seriously.


Sharp at 12.00pm today, I clicked on the link provided by UPU (University Placement Unit) to check if I am admitted to any public universities in Malaysia. I got a grand total of 0 offers out of my nine choices. It is unfortunate to say that I was not surprised, merely disappointed. <br><br>


Just to put it out here first, my first choice was the highly competitive medicine program in Universiti Malaya, with my 2nd to 4th choice being medicine in different universities as well. I know what is going through all your minds now—“only results good not confirm can get into UM”, “UM competition so fierce, didn’t give offer to you also normal”, “4 flat, 4 A* are a dime a dozen”—the above arguments are by and large correct, but do take a moment to read on before giving judgement. Universiti Malaya has more of a stringent requirement for its medicine program compared to other universities, with an additional test, the BMAT (Biomedical admission test) required. BMAT is a test set out and marked by Cambridge Assessment, with most universities in the UK requiring it for medicine applicants. As it is a standardised test taken by all applicants, it plays a heavy weight in all these universities in deciding who to call up for interviews and who to admit. <br><br><br><br>

I was not only rejected by UM, but also by the likes of UKM, UPM and USM for good measure.<br><br>


However, there is a caveat in my application. I did A Levels (STPM equivalent) because I got a scholarship, which is not considered favourable for public university application due to the omnipresent “quotas” for a few reasons. I got the highest score possible for my A Levels with an extra achievement in being Top In Malaysia for a science subject in AS Level. What is that?  Well, earlier this year our [YDP Agong congratulated another student who achieved top in the world for chemistry for IGCSE(SPM equivalent)](https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2021/05/04/king-proud-of-malaysias-top-in-the-world-student-for-chemistry). I know it’s top in the world compared to top in Malaysia for me, but in the context of local students for Malaysian university, it wouldn’t have made a difference. That our YDP Agong formally endorses an achievement in international curricula yet our public university discriminates against it goes beyond me. <br><br>


The issues surrounding doctors has been in public view in recent months. Nevertheless, Malaysia still needs doctors, good doctors and specialists. It’s not as if most of us can just [fly off](https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/malaysias-home-minister-muhyiddin-yassin-recovering-in-singapore-hospital-after-surgery ) to a neighbouring country when we fall sick even if they do provide better medical treatment. The overwhelming majority of Malaysians will have to rely on Malaysian doctors whether we get a simple cold or a brain tumour. The number of private medical schools sprouting in recent years is worrying alongside their low requirements both for establishing the course and for student intake; the lack of transparency and sometimes incomprehensible quotas for medicine in public universities are all contributing a hand in bringing down the quality of future doctors.
