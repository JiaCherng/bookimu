With electric vehicles (EV) being touted as the vehicle of the future, floods of electric vehicles are expected to arrive in hordes in the near future. With car companies around the world turning their focus on this “greener energy”. While it is left to no doubt that energy conversion is more efficient in a factory compared to your own’s car generator and generate low to zero emissions themselves, the question remains. Is the difference large enough?

 
An estimate 12.85m tons of lithium-ion batteries from electric vehicles (EV) are expected to retire between now and 2030. By the same estimate, 10.35m tons of lithium, cobalt, nickel and manganese will be mined for the same. The mining, processing, transporting, manufacturing and ultimately—depending on how used batteries are managed—recycling or disposing are carbon-intensive processes. 

###### RECYCLE?
Recycling is commonly used as an end-all, whether in an economic forum, prime minister questioning or even in the essays of high school students. The truth of the matter is that it is not as straightforward. In richer, more developed countries, hundreds of millions of dollars have been invested by both the private and public sector into the infrastructure and research for recycling, yet it is sorely lagging behind in scale, with most developed countries shipping their ‘recyclable products’ to less developed countries where most of the ‘recyclable products’ end up in landfills. From the words of Dr Anderson, who is the co-director of the Birmingham Centre for Strategic Elements and Critical Materials, "Currently, globally, it's very hard to get detailed figures for what percentage of lithium-ion batteries are recycled, but the value everyone quotes is about 5%." It goes without saying that 5% is nothing to boast about. The percentage will be far worse in Malaysia, where recycling common use batteries is hardly accessible and practised. 

###### SO WHAT NOW?
The better part of the solution as proposed by James Pennington, who leads the World Economic Forum’s circular economy program is far simpler. “If we want to do more with the materials that we have, recycling shouldn’t be the first solution. The best thing to do at first is to keep things in use for longer,” he said. In a research by Greenpeace East Asia, Lithium-ion batteries decommissioned from electric vehicles (EVs) and repurposed for energy storage can meet the entire world’s energy storage needs as early as 2030 when the raw materials required for making the current technologies of batteries will be at risk. Using them to store excess energy in solar farms, wind farms, rural areas, or power plants themselves seemed to a prudent step forward. An energy company in the UK, Enel Group is using 90 batteries retired from Nissan Leaf cars in an energy storage facility in Melilla, Spain, which is isolated from the Spanish national grid. “There is a lot of battery capacity left at the end of first use in electric vehicles,” said Jessika Richter, who researches environmental policy at Lund University.

###### SO IS IT SUSTAINABLE?
As Jessica Richter said, “It’s important to remember that we can have a sustainable product situated within an unsustainable system.” The system and the surrounding infrastructure have not caught up with the production of electrical vehicles. Electric vehicles are not the end all to make our transport systems more friendly, it’s benefits as it currently stand are at most marginal. If you do the maths, in most more developed areas, deploying more petrol-guzzling buses will be even eco-friendlier than switching all the cars to EVs. Conclusion, EVs are only one facet of trying to mitigate the damage to the earth, there are a lot more to be done,
