 After the Ministry of Education has allowed students in Form 5 last year to return to school to better prepare themselves for sitting SPM in the February/March, we’ve seen many complaints from students and parents alike, with petitions sprouting out in change.org and submissions from parents to news sites.

 

But little do they know that they have to sit for SPM. There is simply no alternative. There have been clamours for the ministry to replace SPM with predicted grades like what those taking A Levels had to face last June. However, an important fact was neglected, most A Levels courses have tests and exams every other week; it provides teachers with a rather clear guideline on the threshold and capability of students.

 

The majority of the batch of students sitting for SPM this year however, had not have the same treatment, many students from public schools have had only sat for 1 and ½ exam throughout their academic year last year. One in February right before the pandemic swept through and trials halted halfway when the situation of the pandemic went out of control. If there are complains now, I can’t bear to think what will happen if predicted grades are adopted and students are ‘disappointed’ of their results given.

 

Predicted grades also has its shortcomings. No high achiever would ever wish for predicted grades, where those straddling between the thresholds of grades would benefit the most. Just take a look at United Kingdom the last academic year, where there was a significant inflation of students getting higher grades and messing up the university admission process.

 

It bears to admit that SPM has lost its importance over the years; enrolling into private institutions requires only credits; public institutions are still governed by skewed quotas; JPA is barely offering any scholarships even for those with 9A+-yet being much less lucrative with longer bonds. Yes, SPM has largely been relegated to be merely a pat in the back for most higher achievers, getting A or B doesn’t really matter anymore. Even so, SPM must go on, not to test the students, but to provide some motivation to better prepare them for what will come next.

 

On the other hand, less important tests such as MUET can very well be cancelled. Tests like this requires close physical interaction, not to mention most students have to cross district or travel to an examination centre some distance away to sit for the test. Top ranking university worldwide, NUS, NTU, HKU etc. have already been accepting GCE O-level 1119-which you sat for along with your SPM English-as an English proficiency evidence. That, along with an interview would definitely be sufficient prove to allow for admission into our local university.

 

All that said, students taking SPM, already 18 years old should have the good judgement to avoid all social interactions in school; sit, listen, write and hope for the best. The ministry and school authorities just have to enforce stricter rules and if required suspend misbehaving students.
