title: Touch 'n Go card becoming dormant - GLCs have to do a better job in this pandemic

  Just a few days ago, on the day before my vaccination appointment, I was going through a checklist of things I needed to bring along for the appointment. When I reached “Touch ‘n Go” card (it’s a requirement pretty much anytime you travel around KL/Klang Valley), I had a jolt of realisation. It has been a long time since I last used the card and I had a vague recollection that a cad will become dormant after some period of activity. A few years ago, most tolls in Klang Valley have abolished the use of ‘tunai’ booths. I did not want to be that one person to hold up a whole line of cars at a toll booth, with cars honking behind me. I immediately went online to check the status of my card after registering on Touch ‘n Go eportal and breathed a sigh of relief when it showed that there was still 18 days before my card expires.


 

  Since the start of the pandemic and subsequently our Movement Control Order way back on March 18 2020, with restrictions and SOPs in place, travel by road has largely only been left to those in the workforce. With the exception of a few months back in 2020 when our cases were still under control, those of us who do not require commuting by car has largely left our TNG card idle in our wallet.

 

  After some digging on the internet, I came across the Master Terms and Conditions for Touch ‘n Go Card, it was clearly stated that a card will become dormant after being idle for 12 months. Not just that, once your card becomes idle, the company will immediately deduct RM5.00 with an additional deduction of RM 5.00 every 6 months. And your card cannot be reactivated once it becomes dormant, effectively forfeiting the card forever.

 

  To avoid that, you can check your touch n go status on their eportal. However, if your card is going to become dormant soon and you are stuck in an area with stricter restrictions(or you just don’t want to go out for nothing), there is still a last resort. You can link your card to touch n go ewallet to avoid dormant status. Nevertheless, it is still too late for many and not accessible to some. However, and most importantly, the onus lies on the head of Government Linked Companies (GLCs) like TnG to provide more sympathetic services and not add on more trouble (even if it’s small) in these worrying times.<br><br>
