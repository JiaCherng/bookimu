title: Are we too optimistic - Following up on Covid testing in Malaysia and around the World

<p>The daily Covid cases in Malaysia has hovered around 20,000 for a few weeks now. At the same time that the situation
    is deteriorating, the government has laid clear that its last hope was in vaccinating the large majority of the
    adult population in Malaysia, in the hope that we'll come to achieve herd immunity. Yet all evidence proves that it
    may not be as easy as some make it to be. Just take a look at the interactive graph below from ourworldindata.org
    and you'll see that cases are still drastically rising even for countries with world-leading vaccination
    percentages.</p>

<p>Not just that, a depressing upward tick of the curve for Covid cases in Malaysia comes after the government has
    enforced stricter rules and SOPs, with full MCO (Movement Control Order) in place since 1st June. Even with
    virtually the whole state of Selangor—which is Malaysia's largest state, thus the state with most cases—being put in
    Enhanced MCO for 2 weeks since 3 July, the clear upward curve shown above can very well be taken as portents of
    worse to come. With accumulated cases now being more than 1.4 million, roughly 1.5 in 30 Malaysians have had—or
    still has—Covid.</p>

<p>And that is not all, from 1881.50 Covid tests per positive case on 5 July 2020, the same figure has dropped to 8.80
    on July 27. This drastic drop can very well be attributed to the sharp increase of Covid cases, yet it is another
    indication that the situation has come to take a turn for the worse. With the blatant exception of Singapore and
    Australia, Malaysia lags roughly 2 times behind that of most countries and is only slightly better than some of our
    neighbours in South East Asia. Another fact that needs to be noted is that many Western countries have already
    employed self-testing kits since the beginning of this year and that most of the results coming from that are not
    included in the official data while Malaysia has only approved its use on 20 July. This fact clearly dispels the
    notion and excuse of some who attributed the recent increase of cases to the increased testing. As a matter of fact,
    it proves that it is urgent that we ramp up testing and inevitable that the number of cases will skyrocket if we do
    so.</p>

<p>When we compare the figure of the first graph with the graph below, the United States and the United Kingdom are 2
    countries that stand out. Both with their vaccination rate and their cumulative case. For the case of the United
    Kingdom, with a leading vaccination rate that led to "Freedom Day" on 19 July 2021, the cumulative confirmed case
    has shown an exponential increase since.</p>

<p>Take this with a significantly decreasing—because of vaccination—yet not negligible case fatality rate, and the only
    conclusion I can come to is that the outlook is bleak. Malaysia has lost control of its Covid cases since the Hari
    Raya/Ramadhan celebration. And the current trend strongly indicates that we'll follow the footsteps of the UK—which
    is definitely not a model for Covid mitigation and control—, albeit a more conservative one. At the same time, the
    people have to hope dearly that there wouldn't be any more infectious or deadly variants to come. When the time
    comes as it must, those who had vaccinations will be left to try their luck and hope that they themselves won't be
    the unfortunate (and currently, few) ones to have severe symptoms or die even with vaccinations.</p>

<p>With an update on 18 August by the Director General of Health, the situation seems to be going in the direction of
    the scenario I raised above. </p>
